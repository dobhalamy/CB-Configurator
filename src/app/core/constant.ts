  },

    id: 4,
    question: 'Is there a fee for using this service?',
    answer:
      'No! We do not charge our customers. Unlike other auto brokers that charge the customer, we are focused on working with people who really need a car and want to work with us. Therefore, we do not feel it is appropriate to charge upfront for our service.',

      'Why are vehicles photos on the CarBlip website not identical to the photos I see on manufacturer websites?',
    answer:
      'CarBlip uses a third party supplier for all car images. In most cases, CarBlip does not obtain vehicle photos from the automobile manufacturers, so the angle, orientation, lighting, and other variables may differ from photos of the same model you see on an automobile manufacturer’s website.
